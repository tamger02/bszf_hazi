\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
CMSIS Cortex-\/M Peripheral Access Layer for Silicon Laboratories microcontroller devices. 

This is a convenience header file for defining the part number on the build command line, instead of specifying the part specific header file.

\begin{DoxyVerb}* Example: Add "-DEFM32G890F128" to your build options, to define part
*          Add "#include "em_device.h" to your source files
* \end{DoxyVerb}
